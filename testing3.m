% I added this as an edit, and then committed but didn't push
% Then I checked github, and nothing had changed...

%Then I wrote this, committed, pushed, and checked again...
% AND low and behold it was uploaded!

%And the blue square returned. (Even though it was saved locally.)

% It looks like I need to commit, and then push, authenticating every time
% (which is a slight pain)

% OK, I've followed the instructions here:

% and perhaps that means I won't have to enter my password when I push
% now...
